BUSINESS\n\n(a)    GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\n       The Black & Decker Corporation  (collectively with its subsidiaries,  the\n       Corporation),  incorporated in Maryland in 1910, is a global marketer and\n       manufacturer  of  quality  products  used in and  around the home and for\n       commercial applications.  With products and services marketed in over 100\n       countries,  the Corporation enjoys worldwide  recognition of strong brand\n       names and a superior  reputation  for quality,  design,  innovation,  and\n       value.\n           The  Corporation  is one of the world's  leading  producers  of power\n       tools, power tool accessories, and residential security hardware, and the\n       Corporation's  product lines hold leading market share positions in these\n       industries.  The  Corporation  is a major global  supplier of  engineered\n       fastening and assembly  systems.  The  Corporation  is one of the leading\n       producers  of faucets in North  America.  These  assertions  are based on\n       total volume of sales of products  compared to the total market for those\n       products and are supported by market  research  studies  sponsored by the\n       Corporation as well as independent  industry statistics available through\n       various trade organizations and periodicals,  internally generated market\n       data, and other sources.\n           As  more  fully   described   below   under   the   caption   \"Recent\n       Developments\",  in  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial\n       Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of Part II of this\n       report  under the  caption  \"Strategic  Repositioning\",  and in Note 2 of\n       Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II\n       of this  report,  during 1998,  the  Corporation  divested its  household\n       products   business,   excluding  the  cleaning  and  lighting   products\n       component,  in North  America,  Central  America,  the  Caribbean,  South\n       America (excluding  Brazil),  and Australia,  as well as its recreational\n       products business,  and glass  container-forming and inspection equipment\n       business for aggregate cash proceeds, net of selling expenses paid during\n       1998, of $653.6 million.\n           During 1995, the Corporation  sold  PRC Realty  Systems,  Inc. (RSI),\n       and PRC Environmental  Management,  Inc. (EMI), for aggregate proceeds of\n       approximately  $100 million.  In February 1996, the Corporation  sold PRC\n       Inc.  to  Litton  Industries,   Inc.,  for  approximately  $425  million.\n       Together,  PRC  Inc.,  RSI  and EMI  composed  the  Corporation's  former\n       information   technology  and  services  (PRC)  segment.  For  additional\n       information about the discontinued PRC segment,  see the discussion below\n       under  the  caption  \"Discontinued  Operations\"  and  Note 13 of Notes to\n       Consolidated  Financial  Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this\n       report.\n           In  April  1996,  the  Corporation  replaced   its  former  unsecured\n       revolving credit facility,  which was scheduled to expire in 1997, with a\n       new unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility), which will\n       expire  in  2001.

Business\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n     IKONICS Corporation (IKONICS or the Company) was incorporated in Minnesota as Chroma-Glo,\nInc. in 1952 and changed its name to The Chromaline Corporation in 1982. In December 2002, the\nCompany changed its name to IKONICS Corporation. The Company develops, manufactures and sells\nlight-sensitive liquid coatings (emulsions) and films for screen printing and abrasive etching.\nThe Company also markets inkjet receptive films and ancillary chemicals. The Company resells\nequipment and other consumables to provide a full line of products and services to its customers.\nIn 2006, the Company began to offer custom etching services for silicon wafers, glass wafers and\nindustrial ceramics based on proprietary technology, and also began a research program to develop\ndigital imaging technologies for niche industrial markets. The Companys products serve the screen\nprinting, awards and recognition, signage, electronics, aerospace, and industrial ceramics and\nindustrial digital inkjet markets, as well as other industrial markets. On December 29, 2006, the\nCompany acquired the image mate\n®\n line of screen print photochemical products and adhesives from\nFranklin International. These products continue to be sold under the image mate\n®\n brand, primarily\nthrough established image mate\n®\n distribution, although\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nsome cross fertilization between the image mate\n®\n and Chromaline brands does occur. In 2006, the Company\nestablished the IKONICS Imaging business unit, which comprises PhotoBrasive Systems, serving the\nawards and recognition, and monument markets; and Industrial Solutions, serving industrial markets\nfor electronic wafers and ceramic etching, as well as providing industrial digital inkjet and sound\ndeadening technology. In 2009, Industrial Solutions expanded to the Companys new facility, which\nwas completed at the end of 2008.\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\n\n\n     IKONICS traditional core technology is the use of photochemicals to create masks or stencils\nfor the transfer of images by screen printing or abrasive etching. Recently, the Companys product\noffering has expanded to include inkjet receptive substrates, digitally generated acid resist\ntransfer films, etched electronic wafers and industrial, ceramics, and sound absorbing technology\nfor the aerospace industry.\n\n\n\nDistribution\n\n\n\n\n     The Company currently has approximately 200 domestic and international distributors. The\nCompany also sells its products through direct sales to certain end users who do not require the\nservices of a distributor. In addition, IKONICS markets and sells its products through magazine\nadvertising, trade shows and the internet.\n\n\n\n     IKONICS has a diverse customer base both domestically and abroad and does not depend on one or\na few customers for a material portion of its revenues. In 2009 and 2008, no one customer\naccounted for more than 10% of net sales.\n\n\n\nQuality Control in Manufacturing\n\n\n\n\n     In March 1994, IKONICS became the first firm in northern Minnesota to receive ISO 9001\ncertification. ISO 9000 is a series of worldwide standards issued by the International\nOrganization for Standardization that provide a framework for quality assurance. ISO 9001 is the\nmost comprehensive standard of the ISO 9000 series. The Company has been recertified every three\nyears beginning in 1997. IKONICS quality function goal is to train all employees properly in both\ntheir work and in the importance of their work. I\n"
