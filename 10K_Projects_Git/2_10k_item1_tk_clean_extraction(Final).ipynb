We seek to enable the full therapeutic potential of next-generation sGC\nstimulators. sGC stimulators are small molecules that act synergistically with nitric oxide on sGC to boost production of\ncyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP. cGMP is a key second messenger that, when produced by sGC, regulates diverse and\ncritical biological functions throughout the body including blood flow and vascular dynamics, inflammatory and fibrotic\nprocesses, metabolism and neuronal function.

Business. \nOverview \nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER to treat serious neurologically mediated conditions. We are developing nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic pruritus, chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, or LID, in patients with Parkinson’s disease. These conditions share a common pathophysiology that is mediated through opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Due to nalbuphine’s mechanism of action as a modulator of opioid receptors, we believe it has the potential to be effective in treating each of these conditions. We are currently conducting a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of nalbuphine ER, which we refer to as the PRISM trial, in patients with severe pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, and expect to report top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2020.

Business\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering and developing novel, first-in-class immunomedicines to treat cancer and other immune-related diseases by restoring normal immune function. We view the immune system holistically and, rather than target one specific immune cell type, we focus on understanding biological pathways, the interactions of cells and the role each interaction plays in an immune response. Through our proprietary Functional, Integrated, NextCure Discovery in Immuno-Oncology, or FIND-IO, platform, we study various immune cells to discover and understand targets and structural components of immune cells and their functional impact in order to develop immunomedicines. We are focused on patients who do not respond to current therapies, patients whose cancer progresses despite treatment and patients with cancer types not adequately addressed by available therapies.

We focus on molecules and pathways whose role in the disease process is well known based on prior research, but have previously failed to yield successful products due to poor efficacy and tolerability. Our unique approach to drug development leverages recent technological advances to design improved drugs, employs early use of biomarkers to confirm biological activity and focuses on abbreviated regulatory pathways. Our first molecular target is aldose reductase, or AR, an enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol under oxidative stress conditions, and is implicated in multiple diseases. Prior attempts to inhibit this enzyme were hindered by nonselective, nonspecific inhibition, which resulted in limited efficacy and significant off‑target safety effects.

BUSINESSOverviewSlack is the leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack is where work happens.The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email (or the Internet or electricity), Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disast\n>>> New item1 new file for year WORK-20 is saved\n\nWORK's folder has been deleted!\n>>> Got 1 for MIRM\n>>> Created new folder for MIRM\n>>> Start extracting item1 sections for MIRM\n \n\n>>>Starting open files 1 for MIRM\n>>> the file to be extracted is 0001564590-20-010471.txt\n\n>Item 1. Business. \n \nOverview\n \nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a late-stage pipeline of novel therapies for debilitating liver diseases. We focus on diseases for which the unmet medical need is high and the biology for treatment is clear. Our pipeline consists of two clinical-stage product candidates with mechanisms of action that have potential utility across a wide range of orphan cholestatic liver diseases. We are initially developing maralixibat for the treatment of pediatric patients with Alagille syndrome (“ALGS”) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (“PFIC”). Based on improvements in pruritus, or itching, and other outcomes and disease markers observed in Phase 2 clinical trials, we are planning to initiate a rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus associated with ALGS in the third quarter of 2020.
